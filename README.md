# nuix_test

## Assumptions:
- The correct URL is https://www.booking.com
- There is no validation for the booking search results test case

## Things to watch out:
- Scenario: Invalid Password => can sometimes fail due to bot security measures
- Scenario: Search for car rentals => fails most of the time due to bot security measures

## How to run tests:
1. ```npm install```
2. Run one of the following:
```npm run wdio-authentication```
```npm run wdio-searchAccomodations```
```npm run wdio-searchCarRentals```

## Bonus Points:

### What other scenarios would you automate in addition to the scenarios listed in this assessment?
Below are some items to name a few:
- Check that the headers that redirect you to an external site works as expected
- Attraction search 
- Airport Taxis search
- Recent booking searches
- Recommended locations

### How would you structure your tests and test suite? Why?
I will use page object model and have a file per page (i.e. Booking, Car Rentals, Attractions, Airport Taxis)

I'd also create a different file for shared components (i.e. Header, Calendars)

For the test suite, it would be on a per page as well since it follows how the users would use the site and be more intuitive for whoever is working on it

### Assuming you had access to the source describe what other ways you would improve on the framework and testing of the application? Explain how you would implement it (donâ€™t have to implement it). Think big as this is to be an enterprise solution
I would create a whitelisted environment (dev) where I can run my test where the bot security measures are not active.

I'd also probably add a few more aria on different buttons so that I can easily hook my tests on to it.

I'm also going to push to move most of the tests on a level lower than the UI tests to reduce time and increase reliability. This will probably be done by rendering a specific page via virtual dom's (React's testing library for example). Other scenarios like navigation and E2E scenarios can still be done on the UI level.
